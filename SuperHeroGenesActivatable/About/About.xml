  <description>
This mod makes super genes slightly more balanced by making the Super Genes have an activatable ability associated with them instead of constant stat bonuses. For example, instead of always having a massive bonus to strength, the pawn gains an activatable ability that grants the same stat boosts (Carry Capacity * 100 and Melee Damage * 20). The longer the pawn has the ability active, the more focused they become, but the more strain it puts on their heart. After 12 hours, the pawn has an ever increasing chance to have a heart attack. The abiilty can be deactivated at any time as long as the pawn is conscious and capable of movement.

The average chance of heart attack per day for each tier is:
Safe: 0%
Unsafe: 1%
Alarming: 10%
Dangerous: 100%
Perilous: 1,000% 

WARNING: Each active super power calculates heart attack chance independently, meaning that having muliple powers active at the same time increases the risk of a heart attack considerably.

This is CE Compatible
